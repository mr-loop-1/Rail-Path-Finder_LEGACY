**Note: The Mongodb database may refuse to connect sometimes. I am finding a fix for that**

This is a Metro Rail Path Finder app I made for Dev.to + MongoDb Atlas Hackathon. It sources its data from Mongodb Atlas Database.
Technology Used: Expressjs, MongoDb Atlas

## To run the app
Just make sure that node and npm are installed and 
```
npm start
```
And it will be deployed on `http://localhost:3000/users/details`.
The calculation may get slow for longer paths.
