# metro-path-mongodb

This is a Metro Rail Path Finder app.

Stack Used: Expressjs, MongoDb Atlas

## To run the app
Just make sure that node and npm are installed and 
```
npm start
```
And it will be deployed on `http://localhost:3000/users/details`

**Note: The Mongodb database may refuse to connect sometimes. I am finding a fix for that**
